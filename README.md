## Description
Welcome to my project. It is an IRC chat that allows the creation of channels for conference communication between users.
It is developed with the following technologies: 
- `React.js` ⚛️
- `Socket.io`
- `Express.js` 
- `Antd Design` (React UI framework) 🧑‍🎨

## The main goal
The main idea behind the design of the chat is to make it as private as possible, which means that when a user joins the room, he will not be able to read the previous messages written by other chat users.
This is caused by the fact that messages are not stored in a database. Тhey are only transmitted from the socket server to all participants (sockets) in the channel.

## Features
- Responsive design
- Ability to customize your avatar
- Ability to display online users
- Notifications ⚠️
- Likes ❤️
- List of users who liked a particular message 💌

## Motivation
My motivation is to demonstrate the communication in the client-server model.
And also to develop the most user-friendly interface as possible when the devices' screens are of different sizes... 🙂
